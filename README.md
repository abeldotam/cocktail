# Cocktail

This website is just a simple search bar that can give you recipes for some cocktail, based on the API of [TheCocktailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/).

You can try it just here: https://cocktail-lovat.vercel.app/

The interesting thing about this website is tha: I didn't code it.

I juste gave to Cursor that 2 only following prompt, and voil√†: I have a fully fonctionnal website.

*(P.S: I'm sure that in few years, it will pretty normal, even standard, to have a fully website done from scratch with some AI, but at the time I write this lines, that's pretty awesome).*
